# Master module

This manual provides basic instruction on usage of the master module of a Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes inspired Arduino build.

## Basic operation

- Make sure the turnkey mechanism is locked in the **green** open position.
- After switching the device on, the user can select a time limit by turning the knob and choose the number of strikes by pressing the button.
- The game begins after moving the turnkey mechanism into the **red** closed position.
- The module displays time that the player has to defuse the bomb, number of strikes, which are indicated on two LEDs to the left of the display.
- The player can win by defusing all modules, in which case the master module will display the word "done"
- If the number of strikes reaches the limit set during the setup phase or if the time runs out, the player loses and the master module will display the word "fail".
